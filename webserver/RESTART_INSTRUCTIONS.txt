ðŸ§¹ CLEANUP COMPLETED - READY FOR FRESH START

The corrupted ML training data has been removed. Here's what to do next:

1. ðŸŽ¯ RUN THE EA WITH CORRECTED DIRECTION RECORDING
   - The EA now correctly records opening deal types (not closing)
   - This will generate clean, properly labeled training data
   - Run a Strategy Tester session to collect new data

2. ðŸ“Š COLLECT FRESH TRAINING DATA
   - Run the EA in Strategy Tester for at least 50-100 trades
   - Ensure both buy and sell trades are generated
   - The data will be saved with correct direction labels

3. ðŸ¤– RETRAIN THE ML MODEL
   - Run: python strategy_tester_ml_trainer.py
   - This will train on the fresh, correct data
   - Generate new optimized parameters

4. ðŸ”„ UPDATE THE EA
   - The new parameters will be automatically copied to MetaTrader
   - Test the EA with the fresh ML model

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- All previous ML training data was corrupted due to wrong direction labels
- The new data will have correct buy/sell labels based on opening deal types
- This should result in much better ML model performance
- The separate buy/sell models will now be trained on correctly labeled data
