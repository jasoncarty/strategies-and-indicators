    🔄 ML RECOVERY PLAN
    
    Phase 1: Data Collection (2-4 weeks)
    - Test EA on multiple symbols (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, XAUUSD)
    - Test on multiple timeframes (M5, M15, H1, H4, D1)
    - Collect data from different market conditions
    - Ensure no data leakage in collection
    
    Phase 2: Data Validation (1 week)
    - Run data quality analysis
    - Check for data leakage
    - Validate feature quality
    - Ensure temporal separation
    
    Phase 3: Conservative ML Training (1 week)
    - Use improved ML trainer
    - Implement time series validation
    - Start with very conservative thresholds
    - Test on out-of-sample data
    
    Phase 4: Gradual Re-enabling (2-4 weeks)
    - Enable ML with very conservative settings
    - Monitor performance closely
    - Gradually adjust thresholds
    - Keep fallback to non-ML mode
    
    Phase 5: Full ML Integration (ongoing)
    - Optimize ML parameters
    - Implement continuous monitoring
    - Regular model retraining
    - Performance tracking
